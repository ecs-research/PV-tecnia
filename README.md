# PV-tecnia
**PV-tecnia** ([https://pvtecnia.com](https://pvtecnia.com)) is a free photovoltaic software provided as an online service (SaaS), capable of creating, planning and simulating the physical and electrical parameters of PV modules, PV arrays, inverters, batteries, locations, consumption profiles and full PV systems.

### Key features:

- Capable of creating from the scratch, model and simulate the full PV system chain, including the installation custom consumption profile, the location meteo characteristics, the PV modules used, the PV arrays mounted, an inverter and, optionally, a storage bank:

- Supports the creation of systems with N arrays (mixing different layouts and configurations), 1 DC/AC inverter and 1 storage bank (with multiple batteries):

- Offers a huge database of PV elements:
  - **42000 modules** from CEC, Sandia and PAN databases.
  - **11000 inverters** from CEC, ADR and OND databases.
  - **800 batteries** from CEC and BTR databases.

- User can register its own consumption profiles, locations, PV modules, inverters and batteries, by entering their physical and electrical parameters, analysing their behaviour individually:

- PV modules and PV arrays analysis includes: DC-out power, I-V and P-V curves, computed under the SDM (single diode model) for several global POA irradiances and different panel cell temperatures:

- PV arrays analysis also includes the shading characteristics of the array (its impact in the array I-V and P-V curves), and most common array losses (shading losses, thermal losses, irradiance losses, module nameplate quality losses, mismatch losses, array connections losses, DC wiring losses, soiling losses, ageing losses, LID losses, IAM losses, light soaking losses, spectral losses, unavailability losses, snow losses, etc):

- Inverters analysis includes: efficiency and AC-out power variation curves (versus DC-in power, DC-in current and DC-in voltage):

- Batteries analysis includes: time series variation of state-of-charge (SoC, when charging), depth-of-discharge (DoD, when discharging), current, voltage, capacity and temperature, the battery voltage variation versus the SoC / DoD states and the capacity, for different input change or output discharge power flows, and the battery performance parameters (capacity reduction variation as the number of charge/discharge cycles increases and as the temperature drops):
